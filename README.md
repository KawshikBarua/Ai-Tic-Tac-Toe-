# Ai-Tic-Tac-Toe-
This is my try on creating a computer playable tic tac toe game. 
For making the computer predict the next best move i have implemented minmax algorithm.
Using Alpha Beta pruning would have been a better option since it prevents uneccessary iteration down the tree.
There are 2 files here.

main.py - contains the code for building the graphic interface which helps the user visualize his/her moves and 
what move Ai made.

TicMod.py - contains Minmax algorithm which is responsible for making the predictions.
